# Is There a Correlation Between the Incidents of Fraud vs. The Spending Size, Population Size, Age Group and Demographics?

# Project Overview 
Credit card fraud transactions are a fear that many americans have as they happen so frequently! They cost financial companies and conusmers themselves millions of dollars every year. Is there a better, more efficent way to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or not in real time. If so, which parameter is it? 

By looking at a dataset with over 550,000 transactions, and analyzing the other identifying factors that were in those transactions, we aim to discover any actionable insights.

# Project Structure
For this project, we used a dataset with different parameters and tried to find which one was most efficent.

Our final code can be found in mjrafol/EDA_Project-1.

Finally, we created a powerpoint slide to summerize our findings and insights.
