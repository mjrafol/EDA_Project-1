# Is There a Correlation Between the Incidents of Fraud vs. The Spending Size, Population Size, Age Group and Demographics?

# Project Overview 
Credit card fraud transactions are a fear that many americans have as they happen so frequently! They cost financial companies and conusmers themselves millions of dollars every year. Is there a better, more efficent way to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or not in real time. If so, which parameter is it? 

By looking at a dataset with over 550,000 transactions, and analyzing the other identifying factors that were in those transactions, we aim to discover any actionable insights.

# Project Structure
For this project, we used a dataset with different parameters and tried to find which one was most efficent.

Our final code can be found in mjrafol/EDA_Project-1.

Finally, we created a powerpoint slide to summerize our findings and insights.

 # Objective
Analyze the fraud data set to determine correlation between fraud incidence, spending size, age group, demographics and time of transaction so awareness campaigns can be directed to these groups. Perform other relevant analysis from the data set.

Statement: There is no correlation between the spending size, age group, demographics and time of transaction vs. fraud incidence.

# Hypothesis
Ha = There is strong positive correlation between the spending size, age group, demographics and time of transaction and fraud incidence.
Hb = There is strong negative correlation between the spending spending size, age group, demographics and time of transaction and fraud incidence.
Ho = There is no correlation between the spending size, age group, demographics and time of transaction and fraud incidence.
# Methodology
We identified Kaggle’s Simulated Credit Card Fraud Dataset, used the pandas Application of Pandas’ cut / bin and groupby functions on Dataset, and requested Census API to do bar chart, scatter plot and and linear regression.
